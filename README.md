# **BlueBotCar: The Arduino-Powered Smart Car Project**

## **Overview**
Welcome to **BlueBotCar**, a smart robot car built using Arduino! ðŸš— This project was an exciting journey of bringing together hardware and software to create a versatile car with two unique operating modes: **Auto Mode** and **Controller Mode**. 

## *Summary of the Project:* 

Imagine a car thatâ€™s half genius, half obedient servant. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve built! My robot car has two personalities: Auto Mode, where it confidently struts around like it owns the place, dodging obstacles with ultrasonic sensors, and Controller Mode, where it humbly listens to me via Bluetooth, letting me call the shots.

### **Section 1: The Birth of a Robot Car**
First things first: getting this little guy on its feet (or wheels, rather). I powered everything up, gave the servo a friendly nudge to start measuring distances, andâ€”voilÃ ! The car was alive and kicking, ready to conquer the world (or at least the living room).

### **Section 2: Bluetooth Bonding Time**
Next up, I had to establish a connection with my robot friend. Think of it as teaching your pet to respond to commandsâ€”but instead of treats, I used Bluetooth. After a few seconds of bonding, we were fully connected, and I could steer this bad boy with the ease of a swipe.

### **Section 3: The Grand Finale â€“ Action Time!**
Now, for the moment of truth. I let the car loose in Auto Mode, where it gracefully avoided obstacles like a pro. Then, I took the reins in Controller Mode and showed it whoâ€™s boss. Whether it was navigating autonomously or obeying my every command, this robot car proved itâ€™s got style and smarts.
