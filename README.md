# **BlueBotCar: The Arduino-Powered Smart Car Project**

## **Overview**
Welcome to **BlueBotCar**, a smart robot car built using Arduino! ðŸš— This project was an exciting journey of bringing together hardware and software to create a versatile car with two unique operating modes: **Auto Mode** and **Controller Mode**. 

- **Auto Mode:** BlueBotCar autonomously navigates its environment, using ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and make real-time adjustments to its path.
- **Controller Mode:** In this mode, BlueBotCar responds to Bluetooth commands, allowing manual control for more precise navigation.

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Setting Up BlueBotCar**
The first step in bringing BlueBotCar to life was assembling the hardware. I started by aligning the servo and ensuring the motors were correctly initialized. This setup allowed the car to read distances and prepare for movement.

### **2. Connecting via Bluetooth**
Next, I established a Bluetooth connection between my device and BlueBotCar. This connection allowed for remote control of the car, enabling the switch between Auto Mode and Controller Mode with ease.

### **3. Watching BlueBotCar in Action**
Finally, it was time to put BlueBotCar to the test. In Auto Mode, it navigated independently, avoiding obstacles like a pro. Switching to Controller Mode, I took control and directed its movements with precision.
